This trend is being driven by the rise of technology, which has made it easier for people to find and connect with clients.  The gig economy has both positive and negative implications for society. On the one hand, it can provide people with more flexibility and freedom to choose their own work. On the other hand, it can lead to job insecurity and lower wages. It is important to find ways to ensure that the gig economy works for everyone, not just for those at the top. This could include providing more protections for gig workers, such as minimum wage laws and access to healthcare."
